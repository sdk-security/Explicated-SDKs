1) [Old] models bounded-verified by Poirot

This folder contains the previous version of the models for the SDKs we studied. They were bounded-verified by Poirot (with bound 5). Poirot is a Microsoft tool available at http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/poirot/

2) [New] models in BoogiePL with complete proofs

This folder contains the new version of the models, written in  BoogiePL. The assertions and loop invariants are proved, as opposed to bounded-verified as in the previous version. In addition, this version is more polished than the previous one. Boogie is available at http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/boogie/.
